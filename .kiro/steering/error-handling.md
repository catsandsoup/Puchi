# Error Handling & Root Cause Analysis

## Critical Error Prevention
- Always validate user input before processing
- Check for nil/empty values in all user-facing operations
- Implement proper bounds checking for arrays and collections
- Handle permission denials gracefully (camera, location)
- Validate media file sizes and formats before storage
- Implement proper error boundaries for async operations
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging production issues

## Memory Management
- Optimize images before storage (max 1024px, 50% JPEG quality)
- Implement size limits for media collections (50MB total)
- Clean up temporary files after video compression
- Monitor UserDefaults storage size for note persistence
- Release large objects promptly after use
- Monitor memory warnings and respond appropriately

## Location Services
- Handle all CLLocationManager authorization states
- Provide fallback behavior when location denied
- Stop location updates after successful capture
- Handle geocoding failures gracefully
- Implement timeout for location requests (30 seconds)
- Show appropriate user feedback for location states

## Media Handling
- Validate image/video data before creating MediaItem
- Handle UIImagePickerController cancellation
- Implement proper error messages for media failures
- Check available storage before saving large files
- Validate media formats and file integrity
- Handle corrupted media files gracefully

## Data Persistence
- Handle JSONEncoder/JSONDecoder failures with fallbacks
- Implement backward compatibility for model changes
- Validate note data before saving to UserDefaults
- Provide recovery for corrupted saved data
- Implement data migration strategies
- Add data integrity checks on app launch

## Network & Permissions
- Handle all permission request scenarios
- Provide clear explanations for permission requirements
- Implement graceful degradation when permissions denied
- Show appropriate UI states for permission requests
- Handle permission changes during app lifecycle

## App Store Compliance
- Ensure all crashes are caught and logged
- Implement proper error reporting without user data
- Handle edge cases that could cause rejections
- Test on multiple device types and iOS versions
- Validate all user flows work without crashes

## Root Cause Analysis Checklist
When debugging issues:
1. Check console logs for specific error messages
2. Verify user permissions are properly requested
3. Validate data models match expected structure
4. Test memory usage with large media files
5. Confirm UserDefaults keys are consistent
6. Test edge cases (empty strings, nil values)
7. Verify proper cleanup of resources
8. Test on different device types and iOS versions
9. Validate data migration scenarios
10. Check for memory leaks in media handling

## User Experience
- Show loading states during async operations
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Implement retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable
- Prevent data loss through proper validation
- Show progress indicators for long operations
- Implement proper error recovery flows

## Production Monitoring
- Log critical errors without exposing user data
- Track app performance metrics
- Monitor crash rates and common failure points
- Implement health checks for core functionality
- Track user flow completion rates
