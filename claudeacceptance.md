### üîß EDGE CASE ANALYSIS & FIXES

**üêõ LOVE PROMPT TEXT STYLING ISSUE:**
**Problem:** When users tapped love prompts (especially before entering a title), the inserted text appeared small and dark instead of using proper theme colors and font size.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `createThemedAttributedString` was using AttributedString attribute setting, which wasn't consistently applied to UITextView
- `updateUIView` lacked protection for external text insertions from sources like love prompts
- NSAttributedString vs AttributedString styling approach inconsistencies

**Technical Solution:**
1. **Enhanced createThemedAttributedString (`lines 129-144`):**
   - Switched from AttributedString approach to NSAttributedString for reliable font/color application
   - Ensures UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 17) matches UITextView expectations
   - Guarantees UIColor(Color.puchiText) consistency

2. **Added updateUIView Protection (`lines 95-111`):**
   - Enforces font and color attributes for all external text sources
   - Prevents small, dark text from any insertion scenario
   - Maintains compatibility with existing rich text formatting

**Testing Scenarios Verified:**
- ‚úÖ Love prompt click with empty title field - Text appears with correct size and color
- ‚úÖ Love prompt click with existing title - Formatting remains consistent
- ‚úÖ Rich text formatting after love prompt insertion - Bold/italic/underline work properly
- ‚úÖ Theme switching - Colors adapt correctly in light/dark modes
- ‚úÖ Search text highlighting - No regression in existing functionality

**Comprehensive Edge Case Protection:**
- Love prompts insertion (`EntryComposerView.swift:423`)
- Search text highlighting (`SearchView.swift:468, 486`)
- Entry loading from storage (`PuchiApp.swift:535`)
- Legacy data fallbacks (`PuchiApp.swift:503`)
- Text input changes (`textViewDidChange` method)
- External text insertion (`updateUIView` method)

**Ready for Next Priority:** Journal Suggestions System

### üéØ FOCUSED IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
**Target User:** Female, 18-30, tech/social media native, sentimental, values memory safety over features

## üîß CRITICAL MAINTENANCE NOTES

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Rich Text Editor Debugging Guide
**REFERENCE:** `SimpleRichTextEditor.swift:4-41` - Comprehensive maintenance documentation with full debugging checklist

**COMMON TEXT STYLING ISSUES:**
1. **Invisible Text Symptoms:**
   - Text appears but matches background color (invisible)
   - Check for missing `NSAttributedString.Key.foregroundColor` attributes
   - Solution: Use `SimpleRichTextEditor.createThemedAttributedString(from:)`

2. **Small/Dark Text Symptoms:**
   - Text appears smaller than expected (not 17pt)
   - Text appears in system default color instead of theme color
   - Check for missing `NSAttributedString.Key.font` attributes
   - Solution: Ensure `updateUIView` protection is active

3. **External Text Insertion:**
   - **NEVER** use `AttributedString(plainText)` directly
   - **ALWAYS** use `SimpleRichTextEditor.createThemedAttributedString(from:)`
   - **CRITICAL:** NSAttributedString approach more reliable than AttributedString for UITextView

**PROTECTED LOCATIONS (No Changes Needed):**
- Love prompts: `EntryComposerView.swift:423`
- Search highlighting: `SearchView.swift:468, 486`
- Entry loading: `PuchiApp.swift:535`
- Legacy fallbacks: `PuchiApp.swift:503`
- Text input: `textViewDidChange` method
- External insertion: `updateUIView:95-111`

**WARNING SIGNS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS:**
- Any new text insertion functionality MUST use utility functions
- Any AttributedString creation from plain text MUST include color/font attributes
- Test ALL text insertion scenarios in both light and dark themes
- If text appears invisible or wrong size, check SimpleRichTextEditor.swift maintenance docs

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES FOR NEXT INSTANCE

### Key Architecture Patterns
- Follow the established `AudioRecorderManager` pattern for new managers
- Use `@Observable` AppState for reactive UI updates
- Maintain dark theme with pink/purple gradients throughout
- Follow SwiftUI best practices with proper state management

### Code Organization
- Keep all models in `PuchiApp.swift` unless they become too large
- Create focused, single-responsibility view files
- Use consistent naming: `SomethingView.swift` for views, `SomethingManager.swift` for services
- Maintain the established file structure and import patterns

### Testing Strategy
- Build and test frequently during development
- Use iPhone 16 iOS 18.5 simulator as primary test target
- Test on physical device for features requiring hardware (Face ID, GPS, etc.)
- Verify data persistence by force-closing and relaunching app

### Success Metrics
- **Completion Rate:** All 7 remaining features fully implemented
- **Code Quality:** No build errors, minimal warnings, clean architecture
