Puchi to do:


Main View:
1. Fix keyboard not dismissing on tap or on swipe.
2. Centre Media and Location Buttons.
3. Make the love streak smaller, perhaps the words on one line to allow for a much thinner card.
4. Instead of scrolling to view all notes, have a swipe gesture to the right move to another view, where the love note history view is displayed. 
5. Have page dots at the bottom indicating which page they're on.
6. Location button still does not work. I cannot tap it successfully, I am not prompted to allow my location, and the location is not being recorded.
7. If I am moving the love note recents and history to another view, make the Today's love note card larger to reduce white space.
8. When I reset the app under "App Management", the user's image is still visible during the new onboarding experience.
